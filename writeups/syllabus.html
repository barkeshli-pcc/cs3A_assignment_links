<li>Abstract data types</li>
<li>Pointers, dynamics variables and arrays</li>
<li>Classes, objects</li>
<li>Inheritance</li>
<li>Polymorphism</li>
<li>Recursion</li>
<li>Stacks, queues</li>
<li>Exceptions</li>
<li>STL</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Homework:</strong>&nbsp;Along with regular programming assignments, self-tests for each chapter (found in the textbook) are due before completion of the chapter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MediumGrid21"><span><strong><span style="color: #993366; font-size: medium;">** The goal of this course will be to familiarize students with the object-oriented paradigm: &nbsp;Encapsulation,&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 24px;">Inheritance</span>, Polymorphism</span></strong></span></p>
<p class="MediumGrid21"><span style="color: #993366; font-size: medium;"><strong>The major focus of the course will be on data abstraction.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p class="MediumGrid21">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MediumGrid21"><span><strong>Upon completion of the course you should be able to:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Understand what a pointer is and how a pointer variable is stored in memory,</li>
<li>Create classes, understand constructors and destructors, and overload operators</li>
<li>Create a linked list,</li>
<li>Allocate a dynamic 2-dimensional array,</li>
<li>Use parent classes and virtual functions,</li>
<li>Use the C++ standard template library</li>
</ul>

<p class="MediumGrid21"><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>The most important principle that students must understand in this course is the encapsulation principle of object-oriented programming</strong>.</span>&nbsp;Whereas in CS 2 students use primitive data types that are built-in to the C++ language, in CS 3A students will learn to create new data structures. The most important skill that students will walk away with is the ability to create classes which have an easy-to-use, intuitive interface. One of the tools that will be used to accomplish this is overloading operators.&nbsp;<strong>Encapsulation:</strong>&nbsp;The principle of encapsulation in object-oriented programming is that the algorithms, data, and details concerning the structure of an object are hidden. Objects come with a set of member functions which can be used outside of the class, but the details of how the functions work are hidden. The goal is for students to create objects which can be used in multiple programs and classes without allowing those programs and classes to access the variables or any of the other components of the object.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Attendance:</h3>
<p class="MediumGrid21" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Attendance is mandatory for both lab and lecture sessions. All projects are expected to be completed based on specifications discussed in class. If you are not there, you will not know what is expected.</span></p>
<p class="MediumGrid21"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Eight absences will result in being dropped from the class.</span></p>
<p class="MediumGrid21"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">being late to class three times, counts as one absence.</span></p>
<p class="MediumGrid21"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Being more than ten minutes late counts as an absence. Please be on time.</span></p>

<p class="MediumGrid21" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Grading:</strong></p>
<p class="MediumGrid21" style="text-align: left;">Your deliverables fall into one of three categories:</p>
<ol>
<li class="MediumGrid21" style="text-align: left;">Weekly projects</li>
<li class="MediumGrid21" style="text-align: left;">Exams</li>
<li class="MediumGrid21" style="text-align: left;">Final project / Exam</li>
</ol>
<p>The grade for each of the three categories will be calculated using the following table:</p>
<table style="width: 322.197px; height: 144px;" border="1">
<tbody>
<tr style="height: 23px;">
<td style="width: 160.596px; height: 23px;">A</td>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>in order to earn a given final grade, you must have received at least that same grade in all three categories.</p>
<p>In order to receive a B in the course, you must have at least a B in all three categories.</p>
<p>This is to ensure your full participation in all aspects of this class.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Homework:</strong>&nbsp;Along with regular programming assignments, self-tests for each chapter (found in the textbook) are due before completion of the chapter.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;">Projects and labs:</strong><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;"><span>&nbsp;</span>Weekly and biweekly projects are assigned. These are the heart and soul of this course. This is where you will learn everything that will define your career in Computer Science.&nbsp;</span>Lab projects are assigned during lab sessions. You must be present in class to learn what is expected of you for every project. It is not enough that the program runs and produces the desired output. The design must follow what will be detailed during class discussions. Missing class will hurt your grade.</li>
<li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Exams:</strong>&nbsp;Written exams are administered&nbsp;in class and submitted on bluebooks (bluebooks can be purchased from the bookstore.) Exams&nbsp;include design, implementation, and general questions about projects done in this course. There will be absolutely no make up exams given.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Final Project:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>There will be a substantial final project that will be designed according to specifications.</span></li>
<li>
<p class="MediumGrid21"><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="MediumGrid21"><strong>What and How:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>All projects are to be completed to the specifications I outline in class. Both<span>&nbsp;</span><em>what</em><span>&nbsp;</span>needs to be done AND&nbsp;<em>how</em><span>&nbsp;</span>it is to be done. Imagine me as your project leader and&nbsp;the customer. If you are not in class it is your responsibility to get the specifications you missed. I may not have time to repeat an entire lecture for you. This is why it is so important not to miss class.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Test your tools:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Many of the projects we do for this course (and other CS courses) are tools that will be used to develop larger, more complex projects. It is important to test these tools very carefully to avoid bugs in your future projects.</li>
<li>
<strong>Start early:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Project are always more complicated that they appear and at the same time, more daunting while you have not started and are just worried about it. Try to stay ahead of the curve. Falling behind in a CS class means projects (tools) that are not up to spec and generally lacking, causing your future projects that depend on the current ones to suffer. So, start early.</li>
<li>
<strong>Overlapping Projects:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Projects often overlap. Both in the time period they are being developed (you will be working on several projects at the same time) and in their content, meaning what you will learn in one project helps you complete the next. And they are normally designed to enforce similar concepts. So, do not think that just because you are working on one project, you can ignore the class discussions about another project. This will hinder your ability to be in control of your work and makes you fall behind.</li>
<li>
<strong>Don't drag your feet:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>The single biggest factor in good students doing poorly in CS classes is the tendency to wait until someone else has started or has completed a project before you they start on theirs. Thinking "well, nobody else seems to know how to do it, so, I must be ok" This drags the level of the class down and I will not allow it. Be the student who pulls everyone else up. Take responsibility for your own success.</li>
<li>
<strong>Testing and commenting:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>All assignments must be thoroughly tested and the test &nbsp;output must be included in your submission along with a well commented source code and other include files. Commenting must be done to the point where if another programmer sees your code, they can<span>&nbsp;</span><em>easily</em><span>&nbsp;</span>understand what is happening and why. &nbsp;Projects submitted without an adequate test or adequately commented code could<span>&nbsp;</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">lose 10,30, 50 or even 100%</span><span>&nbsp;</span>of the<span>&nbsp;</span>score. Code is of no use without a test and well commented source. The closer we get to the end of the semester, the more points is deducted from &nbsp;your score.<span>Please read the&nbsp;</span><a title="00.1 Deliverables" href="$WIKI_REFERENCE$/pages/g5e2dd9913f0041819bdc65fe02d8a51d">deliverables</a><span>&nbsp;page very carefully.</span>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Late Submissions:</strong> Projects are normally due on Sundays. The project will close on Mondays (except for self test extra credit assignments.) Once a project is closed, you may not submit that project. Please do not email me your project or attach it to the comments section. Canvas is often overloaded when it gets too close to the deadline. Please plan on uploading your assignment four or five hours before the deadline. Think of it this way: the projects are due at least five hours before the official deadline. Late assignments lose 10%</li>
<li>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="MediumGrid21"><strong>Academic Honesty/Student Conduct</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bringing food in the classroom is strictly forbidden. I will obey this rule and I expect you to obey is as well.</li>
<li>See<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.pasadena.edu/ipro/policies/pcc_4520.pdf">Pasadena Area Community College District Policy for Student Conduct and Academic Honesty No. 4520</a><span>&nbsp;</span>for school policy on student conduct.</li>
<li>All projects are assigned as individual projects unless they are specifically marked as a group project. Therefore, your projects must be your work and your work alone.&nbsp;When you work so closely with another student (or other persons) to the point that your code is essentially the same as the other person, you have violated the standards of this course.</li>
<li>Plagiarism (use another person’s words or ideas as your own without proper documentation,) is forbidden.</li>
<li>Do not allow another student login to your CANVAS account.</li>
<li>Do not allow another student to look at your code. Do not look at another student's code.</li>
</ul>
<p class="MediumGrid21">Failure to follow this policy will result in disciplinary action, which can affect your academic standing in the College. Every violation will result in subtraction of twice the maximum credits for that project, no exception. For example, you will receive a -20 on a 10 point project. This will definitely hurt your grade.&nbsp;</p>
