<p class="p1"><strong>A Friendly Reminder:</strong></p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Deliverables:</strong>&nbsp;For every project, submit ALL SOURCE FILES (main.cpp, all header files, and other .cpp files) and a test file in text format. Projects with no test file will earn a score of zero.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Please do not zip the files. Upload each file individually.</p>
<p class="p1">Do not paste or link or upload assignments on the comment box. Upload via the assignment submission link.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Testing:</strong>&nbsp;Test your project fully. All aspects and functionality of the project must be tested. A single run of the function with one input set is not acceptable. Test all edge cases.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>comments:</strong>&nbsp;projects must be fully commented including the comment block at the top of the main.cpp. All functions must include Pre and Post conditions. The code body should be commented. use meaningful variable names.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>NOTE:</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="background-color: #ffff99;">Inadequate, or missing test or documentation will result in deduction of anywhere between 10% to 100% of the grade. Watch your indentation. A poorly indented project could be impossible to read. Poor indentation may result in loss of precious points. Make sure you are submitting the right files. "sorry I forgot my header files == sorry you get a zero for the assignment.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Prototypes:</strong>&nbsp;All functions not in a class must have a prototype with a short comment describing their purpose.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Project Specifications:</strong>&nbsp;Read the description of the projects on Canvas assignments page as well as the textbook's for additional, and crucial information.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Late assignments</strong>&nbsp;:&nbsp;Late assignments will NOT be accepted.</p>
