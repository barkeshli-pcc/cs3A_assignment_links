<h2><strong>WORK ETHICS:</strong></h2>

<li>Test every conceivable scenario.
<ul>
<li>Edge cases.</li>
<li>Empty cases</li>
<li>Too much data cases</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Programs you write are very often tools you will use over and over again.

<li>Be&nbsp;kind to your future self</li>
<li>watch out for bugs. They may look harmless now, but later, they will grow fangs and claws!</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>We will discuss a project while you are deeply involved in another project
<ul>
<li>Do not tune out. Pay attention to what's going on in class.</li>
<li>Do not think "I will ask someone after class." Be the one others ask for help.</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li>Do not copy code from the web.</li>
<li>Do your own work. It's hard, but this is what you need to learn the material.</li>
<li>It gets easier.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The 4.0 club:
<ul>
<li>There are two types of students with very high GPA:
<ul>
<li>Those who get an A at any cost</li>
