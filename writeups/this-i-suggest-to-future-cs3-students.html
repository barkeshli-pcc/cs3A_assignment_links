<title>Assignment: This I suggest to future CS3 students</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>A video, a couple of paragraphs, or even one, a bulleted list, audio, any type of message to communicate to me what I should know about your experience in this class. What can I do to make this class easier to bear? What should the students know coming into this class? What advice do you have for them? or for me?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I REALLY appreciate your input.</p>
