<p>Dynamic Two Dimensional Array (with variable column count per row)</p>
<p>Build lower level functions such as Allocate, Initialize, Get, Read and write...</p>
<p>And then, build two applications for Plane reservation and lab log in and out based on these low level functions.</p>
<p>For lab, you need a LogIn and a Logout function and for Plane, a Reserve and a Cancel function. These functions return true if the operation was successful and false otherwise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For plane, store 0 or 1 to indicate availability and for Lab, store student id to indicate the student is logged into a particular station.</p>
