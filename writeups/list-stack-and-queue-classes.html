<p>Having implemented the low level linked list functions, it is time to take them out for a test drive.</p>
<p>We will use the linked list functions to very quickly build several classes that can then be used in other applications.</p>
<p>although it was not a part of the linked list functions list, you will find it very useful to write these functions before you begin your work. (translation: this list of functions is required)</p>
<p>_Copy(node* head) creates a copy of this list and returns the head.<br>_EraseAll(node* head) erase the list. delete every node in the list.<br>_at(int index)</p>
<p>Aside from the appropriate constructors and the big 3, Empty( ), and the insertions operator, these classes will have at least the following functions:</p>
<p>List:<br>Insert functions,&nbsp;remove, search, find next, the read/write at (takes the index and returns the value stored at the node at that index), the [ ] operator, += operator (append a list),&nbsp;<br>Ask me how to write an at function that can set the value at an index as well as return the value at that index.</p>
<p>SortedList:<br>Insert, Remove, Search, at (this at will be read only - why is that?) [ ] operator,</p>
<p>SortedUnique<br>Insert, Remove, Search, at (this at will be read only - why is that?) [ ] operator,</p>
<p>Stack:<br>Push, Pop, Top, Peek( )</p>
<p>Queue:<br>Push, Pop, Front, Peek( )</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After completing this project, you will begin to understand the importance of separating low level functions from higher level functions.</p>
