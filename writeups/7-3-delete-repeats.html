<p>This program will be implemented using CSTRINGS! Do not use int arrays.</p>
<p>Avoid (convoluted) nested if's inside of nested for loops...</p>
<p>break down your program into well defined functions that perform a single task.</p>
<p>You will need at least two functions to handle the Searching and the Deleteing of the items.</p>
<p>Write the function signatures of these functions before you write anything else.</p>
