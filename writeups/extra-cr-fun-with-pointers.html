<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>EXTRA CREDIT</strong></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>FUN WITH POINTERS</strong></h2>
<p>Read chapter 9 and take a look at the&nbsp;<a title="All you need to know about pointers: (for now)" href="9-dot-00-all-you-need-to-know-about-pointers-for-now.html" data-api-endpoint="9-dot-00-all-you-need-to-know-about-pointers-for-now.html" data-api-returntype="Assignment">All you need to know about pointers: (for now)</a>&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">in the assignments section of canvas.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Write a simple program where you declare some pointers of various types (int, char, etc.) Point these pointers to various variables, arrays, and each other, increment and decrement these pointers, dereference and print them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose is to become comfortable using pointers.</p>
<p>Test this program fully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Extra credit is only given to FUN programs. (10 lines is no fun!)</p>
<p>Comment this program the way I commented the "All you need to know about pointers..." page.</p>
