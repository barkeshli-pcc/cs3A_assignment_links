<p>Lab 5: As discussed in class:</p>
<p>Draw the graph of an equation on the screen. Use the bouncing ball project as a starting point.</p>
<p>The equation can be hard coded or you can enter it from the console:</p>
<p>y = x</p>
<p>y = x^2</p>
<p>y = x ^ 3</p>
<p>y = sin(x)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use appropriate domains for these functions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The system object has a Graph object who in turn owns a Plot object.</p>
<p>The Graph object asks the Plot object for a vector of points.</p>
<p>The Plot object will convert the equation to postfix and use RPN to evaluate the y values of each x in the domain. Each point must be converted to screen coordinates by a translation object before they are pushed into the vector to be returned to Graph.</p>
<p>Submit screen shots of each equation, submit all source files in the project, and do not forget a complete work report.</p>
