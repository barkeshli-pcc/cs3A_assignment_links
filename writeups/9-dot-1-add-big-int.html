<h2><strong>9.1 - Add Big Int</strong></h2>
<p>For this project, rewrite (or write for the first time,) the add big int project from chapter 7:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will use dynamic arrays so that any size number can be added.</li>
<li>Use ONLY the pointer notation:
<ul>
<li>you will NOT use the [ ] operator.&nbsp;</li>
<li>you will not use the ugly *(p + i) notation.</li>
<li>use if you need to access a cell in the array, get a walker and point to the cell you want to access</li>
<li>you may use walker = walker + 1 or walker = walker + i</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The objective here is to get you accustomed to pointers to the point where you are not simply <em>translating</em> array notation to pointer notation. I want you to think in pointers.</li>
<li>Test your program with a simple pair of numbers.</li>
<li>Test your program with overflow</li>
<li>In your output, indicate that you have checked the correctness of &nbsp;your calculation.
<ul>
<li>Do not simply add 1394879595 and 92929484020249 and give me a number that is hard to verify</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
