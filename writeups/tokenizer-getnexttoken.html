<p>â€¦</p>
<p>Take another look at the GetToken description above. We are completing Phase II</p>
<p>Create a main program that takes a string (you can just assign this string, it does not have to be a user input) and continually calls GetNextToken and prints the tokens (this includes SPACES, even though the document does not refer to space tokens) and their type, one per line.</p>
<p>The main objective is to have a functions that can tokenize a string. The main function is purely a test.</p>
<p>&nbsp;This project was developed for CS2 students. So, it is possible that some of the detail, functions names etc might be different from what was discussed at length in class. So, when you see something unfamiliar, just refer to your class notes.</p>
