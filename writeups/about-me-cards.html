<p>1. Change your profile picture on Canvas to the picture of your face.</p>

<p class="p1"> Attach a picture of yourself to the front of your index card (See sample below)and write your full name near your picture. Your picture must be a current picture of your face&nbsp; (not your cutest baby picture, not in your Spiderman suit, not in your Pikachu costume.). I need the photos to help me learn your names, so it must look like you look now.</p>
<p class="p1"> Under your name, write you name phonetically to help me learn the correct pronunciation of your name.</p>
<p class="p1"> Then on the other side and answer the following questions. They can be hand written. You do not have to copy the questions down word by word, but a couple of words to tell me which question you are answering is helpful. See the example I provided.</p>
<p class="p1">1. What is your major?</p>
<p class="p1">2. What are your educational goals? Transfer to UC? USC? CalState?&nbsp; Get a job as a . . . ?</p>
