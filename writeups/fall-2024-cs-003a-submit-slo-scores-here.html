<p>Welcome to your class’s SLO rubric!</p>
<p>Each semester Student Learning Outcome (SLO) scores should be entered in Canvas through an assignment called “<em>course name SLO Rubric</em>” (e.g., GEOL003 SLO Rubric). All course SLOs are listed in the rubric, but you only need to assess the recommended SLO(s) for this term or the SLOs agreed upon by your department. The suggested SLOs to be assessed each term is posted on the<span>&nbsp;</span><a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.pasadena.edu/integrated-planning/slo-assessment/resources-for-faculty/anthology.php" target="_blank">SLO Assessment website</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Check with your Course Coordinator for information about the common assessment that will be used by all course section instructors.</li>
<li>The provided rubric has 4-3-2-1 ratings categorized below. Only whole numbers may be assigned (no decimals).
<ul>
<li>4-exceeds</li>
<li>3-met</li>
<li>2-partially met</li>
<li>1-not met</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If a student does not take the assessment, do not enter anything for them. “N/A” is not an available option.</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: Although these scores will be columns in your grade book, the students will not see them. You can verify this by checking that the column heading has “out of 0 MANUAL”.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns, please check with your Course Coordinator and/or Department Chair.</p>
<p>Thank you for your participation assessing student success at PCC.<br>The Learning Assessment Team</p>
