<li>Use ONLY the pointer notation:
<ul>
<li>you will NOT use the [ ] operator.&nbsp;</li>
<li>you will not use the ugly *(p + i) notation.</li>
<li>use if you need to access a cell in the array, get a walker and point to the cell you want to access</li>
<li>you may use walker = walker + 1 or walker = walker + i</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The objective here is to get you accustomed to pointers to the point where you are not simply<span>&nbsp;</span><em>translating</em><span>&nbsp;</span>array notation to pointer notation. I want you to think in pointers.</li>
<li>Use ONLY dynamic arrays. No static arrays. Do not forget to delete your arrays when you are done with them.</li>
</ul>
