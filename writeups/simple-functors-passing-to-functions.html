</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine you have a function Sort that sorts an array. The function uses another function to compare the elements of the array. Functors allow you to pass this comparison function into your Sort&nbsp;function as an argument. Functors have many applications in&nbsp;Computer Science. For starters, you will use functors to control how your lists are sorted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>How Functors are Used?</strong></span></p>
<p>Here, a test function (this could be a member function belonging to a class) calls the Sort function and passes it the Bigger and then the Smaller functors to let the Sort function know how it wants the elements of an array compared to each other. Note that Bigger and Smaller are classes and as such must be supplied any template arguments they require. Not so with SortArray function which does not.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>What <em>is</em> a Functor?</strong></span></p>
<p>A functor is a simple class or a structure whose parenthesis operator has been overloaded:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/yit8pjvmcssc8cn/Screenshot%202015-11-08%2013.39.16.png?dl=1" alt="Bigger and Smaller classes" width="607" height="399" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Here the Bigger and Smaller classes are templated and each have their parenthesis operator overloaded to take two arguments and return a bool. This enables the two classes to take any type that supports the less than operator</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><strong><span style="color: #993300;">Note:</span> </strong>Both Smaller and Bigger classes use the less than operator so that the provider of the T object (type) need not implement both less than and greater than operators</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Receiving the functor as an argument:</strong></span></p>
<p>In the sort function, we have a template argument called compare and the function itself has an argument&nbsp;of type&nbsp;compare named cmp. The template argument allows objects of various types of classes (types) to be passed to the function. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The function uses the cmp argument to compare the elements of the array. Notice that the object of the class Compare is being called like a function because its parenthesis argument has been overloaded.</p>
<p>The function needs a Compare template argument because we are sending an object from one of two different classes (Smaller or Bigger) as the third argument of the Sort function.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Sending the appropriate comparison object into the sort function:</span></strong></p>
<p>In this test function, FillArray fills the array with a number&nbsp;of random numbers. And PrintArray prints the contents of the array. Notice that the SortArray takes a Functor as an argument:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/0vsi2ea9x8tm6bw/Screenshot%202015-11-07%2021.14.50.png?dl=1" alt="void TestIntSort()" width="492" height="317" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>By passing an instance of the Bigger or the Smaller class&nbsp;to the Sort function, we can change the order in&nbsp;which the function sorts the array.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Note: Be careful with the syntax of passing a functor into a function. (Note the Smaller/ Bigger template argument and the parenthesis.)</p>
<p>Running this function will produce the following results:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #0000ff;">What's Next:</span></p>
<p>Now that we know how to pass Functors to functions, we will take a look at how we can pass a functor to an object when the object is being instantiated. <a id="" class="" title="Functors: Passing to classes" href="$CANVAS_OBJECT_REFERENCE$/assignments/g186dedc069139cab9679ae633f2deb32" target="">&gt;&gt;</a></p>
