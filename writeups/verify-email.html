<title>Assignment: Verify Email</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Write a function to verify the format of an email address:</p>
<p>bool VeryifyEmail(char email[ ]);</p>
<p>Do NOT parse the email array once character at a time. Use cstring functions to do most of the work. Take a look at the available cstring and string class functions on cplusplus website.</p>
<p>Use a two dimensional array to store the acceptable top domain names: "COM", "ORG", "NET", "US", "CN", "CA",etc.</p>
<p>you will extract the top domain string from the email address and check it against this list. The list need not be complete!</p>
